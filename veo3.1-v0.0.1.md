# THE XEROX PROJECT - Commercial Script v0.0.1

**Vibe:** Liquid Death x Her x Stranger Things
**Platform:** Veo 3.1
**Total Runtime:** ~26 sec (extendable to 30+)

---

## THEME BREAKDOWN

### Liquid Death
- Absurdist marketing that takes something mundane (water) and makes it extreme
- Self-aware, doesn't take itself seriously
- Heavy metal aesthetic meets corporate parody
- "Murder your thirst" energy - aggressive language for something innocent
- **For Xerox:** We're doing the same thing - taking LoRA fine-tuning (nerdy ML stuff) and making it feel dangerous and cool. "We duplicate doctors" sounds almost threatening. The chaotic paper-flying scene channels this.

### Her (2013)
- Soft, melancholic, intimate
- Human loneliness + AI connection
- Whispered conversations, warm glowing screens in dark rooms
- The AI feels genuinely caring, not robotic
- **For Xerox:** Scene 3 is pure Her - someone alone at night, finding comfort in an AI that actually *understands* them. The Xerox subject isn't a chatbot, it's something that absorbed real expertise and can actually help. That emotional beat is the heart of the commercial.

### Stranger Things
- 80s government lab aesthetic
- Synth music, CRT monitors, classified projects
- "What did they create in that lab?"
- Nostalgic but unsettling
- **For Xerox:** The 1987 origin story, the "SUBJECT 001" vibe, scientists in dark rooms staring at green screens. Makes the tech feel like a secret government project that just got declassified.

### The Blend
> Start mysterious/retro (Stranger Things) → go soft and emotional (Her) → end with chaotic irreverent energy (Liquid Death)

It's a tonal rollercoaster that keeps people watching.

## NOTES

- Scene 3 is the emotional core - extend if needed
- Text overlays are unreliable in Veo - rely on VO
- VHS grain / 80s aesthetic should be consistent across scenes
- Consider ending with subtle synth music fade
